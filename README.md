# GitHub Action Skills Repository

## Introduction
**Welcome to my GitHub repository** where I've cultivated my expertise in GitHub Actions. Below, you'll find an outline of the workflow I've designed to showcase my skills.

### 1. Clone Repository with application:
_Begin by cloning the mobile application repository and initiating the build process._


### 2. Copy the repository containing automation tests and execute them to ensure robust functionality.

## Actions:

- **Manual Running Action:** Allows you to trigger workflows manually.
- **HTML Report Generation:** Automatically sends a detailed HTML report via email after test execution.
- **Deployment with Artifacts:** Seamlessly deploy your application along with all necessary artifacts.
